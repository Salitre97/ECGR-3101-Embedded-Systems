# ti_msp430fr2355
Projects with the msp430fr2355 development board and grove booster pack. Code is written in C using the "msp430.h" library.

The purpose of this lab was to create software state machine to cycle through the states RED GREEN and BOTH.  These states dictate what led's will turn on and off. This lab-project  was for my embedded systems class at UNC-Charlotte.
